In this assessment you will work in small groups to produce a presentation on [climate drivers and modes of climate variability](http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml).

## Learning Objectives {#A2_2 .unnumbered}

At the completion of this assessment learners will have demonstrated an ability to :

-   explain hydrologic concepts and processes through an oral presentation

-   work effectively in small teams to produce a clear and concise scientific presentation

## Learning Task {#A2_3 .unnumbered}

You will each be assigned to a group to create a 15 minute presentation about one of the following topics:

-   Southern Annular Mode (SAM)
-   Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
-   El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
-   North-west cloud bands
-   Sub-tropical ridge

You may choose another relevant topic subject to approval by the Unit Coordinator

Your presentation should clearly describe the climate driver or climate mode you are focusing on, and clearly explain the role of this in shaping the climate of Western Australia. To complete this task you should comprehensively research your topic, including peer-reviewed literature. All sources must be cited appropriately in you presentation slides.

A video of your presentation should be submitted to the link on LMS. It is recommended that you record your presentation in Teams and then upload the link to the video (not the whole file).

In addition to submitting your group presentation, you are also required to provide a critical review of two other presentations. You review should be completed using the template provided on LMS, and then uploaded via the assignment submission link (also on LMS).
